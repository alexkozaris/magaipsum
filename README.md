# MAGA Ipsum
MAGA Ipsum is a simple tool used to generate placeholder text, inspired by the often hilarious rhetoric and terminology associated with right-wing media and Trump supporters.

The point of this tool is not to promote a political view, just to provide an example of a lorem ipsum-style text generator and have a bit of a laugh.
